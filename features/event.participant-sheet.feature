Feature: Test to go to the participant sheet
  I need to be able to register to an event and login to my account

  Scenario: I can go to the participant sheet of the user
    Given the database is empty
    And the following fixtures files are loaded:
      | @InfrastructureBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/Nomenclature.yml                  |
      | @InfrastructureBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/Template/SheetTemplate.yml        |
      | @InfrastructureBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/Template/RegistrationTemplate.yml |
      | @InfrastructureBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/ASDDays2016Event.yml              |
    And I am logged with "user_asddays_1@proximum.com" on event "http://asddays-2016.vimeet.proximum.dev"
    When I go to this page "/fr"
    And I follow "event.link.see_my_sheet"
    Then I should be on this page "/fr/sheet"
